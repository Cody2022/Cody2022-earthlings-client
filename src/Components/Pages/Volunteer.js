                When it comes to transportation, there are two main challenges
                newcomers face. <br /> The first is the difficulty in
                understanding local public transit which sometimes is a result
                of a language barrier. The second issue is obtaining a driverâ€™s
                license that is recognized in Canada and hence be qualified to
                drive.
