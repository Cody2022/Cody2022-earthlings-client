              Finding housing is critical and an immediate need for newcomers.
              Newcomers, including immigrants and refugees, often face
              increasing barriers to affordable housing. This puts many
              newcomers at risk of homelessness because of various factors,
              such as poverty, racism, discrimination, delays in work permits and/or health related issues.

              When it comes to transportation, there are two main challenges
              newcomers face. <br /> The first is the difficulty in
              understanding local public transit which sometimes is a result of
              a language barrier. The second issue is obtaining a driverâ€™s
              license that is recognized in Canada and hence be qualified to
              drive.

              One of the biggest challenges that newcomers could encounter would
              be a language barrier. Translation and interpretations services

              documents, healthcare, and education for their children.
